<h2>THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From a Home-sick Secretary.</span></p>

<p class="author"><i>By Guildford, Saturday.</i></p>

<span style="display:none;">D</span><span class="smcap">ear Toby</span>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">I hope</span> you will forgive my not
being more precise as to my whereabouts.
The fact is if I can get
away from London for a day or two
without leaving my address, I am
only too glad to do so. I was at
the Cabinet Council on Thursday,
afterwards ran down here, <i>et j'y
reste</i>, at any rate over Sunday. I
am getting more and more tired of
London, and the office sardonically
called &quot;Home.&quot; It has never
been a sweet resting-place, and
of late has grown absolutely
intolerable. I used once to have
Sunday to myself; but now, owing
to the new-born church-going fervour
of the Unemployed, Sunday is
the worst day of the week. So
when opportunity offers, as just
now, I cut the whole business and get me into the sweet seclusion of Surrey.</p>

<p class="indent">I see by the papers that I am about to resign office, and retire into that private
life, upon which during the past twelve months I have looked back with
increasing affection. Perhaps the statement is true, and perhaps the Markiss
would say it is &quot;not authentic.&quot; We shall see. In the mean time, at this
distance from Parliament Street, I get the advantage of perspective in regarding
the office of Home Secretary. Down here it seems odd enough that it should
be so much hankered after by men of various temperaments. <span class="smcap">H-nry J-m-s</span>
wanted it at the time <span class="smcap">H-rc-rt</span> secured it. It had a strange fascination for
<span class="smcap">L-we</span>, and I am disclosing no secret when I mention that my old friend and
patron, <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>, fancies it would suit him down to the ground. I only wish
he would try it. If I were certain that he would come in, it might have some
effect in hastening my decision on the question of resignation. Of course
<span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> and I remain on terms of friendliest regard. I am indebted to him
for a sudden promotion exceeding the hopes of the most sanguine politician.
Still, I would like to see him at the Home Office, if only for a short six months.
He is serenely confident he could grapple with the situation. <span class="smcap">Johnny Russell</span>
was quite a nervous, modest person, compared with <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>. I should really
like to see my old friend in my old chair.</p>

<p class="indent">The post, of course, has its attractions. It is no small thing to be principal
Secretary of State, with a seat in the Cabinet, and an adequate salary. But,
to tell the truth, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, the Home Secretary lives too near the People to
have an uninterruptedly pleasant time. He is too close to, and too frequently
under, the public eye. It is like working in a glass hive. A Foreign Secretary
labours in secret in the Samoan Islands, or some equally remote quarter, and
months elapse before the publication of the Blue Book places his labour under
the criticism of the public. The Secretary for the Colonies works under similar
conditions, whilst the First Lord of the Admiralty and the War Secretary,
except upon rare occasions, have only their respective Services to deal with.</p>

<p class="indent">But the Home Secretary is, necessarily, always at home to impertinent
lookers-in, or idle callers who have not sufficient business of their own to attend
to. If anything goes wrong with the water or the gas, if a country Magistrate
makes a more than usually particular ass of himself, if a policeman arrests the
wrong woman in Regent Street, if there is a procession through the parks or
a meeting in Trafalgar Square, it's ever the Home Secretary that is wrathfully
turned to for explanation. When things go well with London or the Provinces,
you never hear the Home Secretary's name mentioned. The condition of
affairs may be due to his admirable administration, but
there is no recognition of his agency. On the other hand,
if the least thing connected with his department goes
wrong, he is held personally responsible, and the fiendish
newspapers fall upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">That is my experience after a little more than twelve
months in office, and if I am a little wearied of it who
shall blame me? Why should I remain the butt of all
the captious critics throughout the country? I have no
hour, except these stolen ones, that I can call my own.
All the pleasures and recreations of private life are
swallowed up in official cares. Why should I longer
submit to be engulfed in this state of slavery? I am
not in the absolute prime of youth; but still, as we
Statesmen go, I am not old. For example, I have seen
but two summers more than that elderly young beau,
<span class="smcap">H-nry J-m-s</span>. Someone once said of me, that for my
recorded age, I had the youngest-looking body in the
House of Commons. That is a subtle distinction, the
value of which I cannot grasp. I know that I have been
a buck in my time, and if I only get my time to myself
once more, I may again become as ornamental as I am
now useful. I will think it over, and probably in the
course of the next few weeks you may hear what
resolution I have taken.</p>

<p class="author">Yours faithfully, <span class="smcap">H-nry M-tth-ws</span>.</p>

<h2>A BLACK AFFAIR AT HAYTI.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Foreign Office, whether represented by Lord
<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> or Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>,&mdash;two &quot;berries,&quot; so that we
are to judge of the worth of our Foreign Office by its
berries, not by its fruits,&mdash;ought to be hauled over the
coals&mdash;the victim's name being suggestive of this process&mdash;by
the British Public. Mr. <span class="smcap">Coles</span> was innocent of
the charge brought against him, was convicted in the
face of evidence; and as there was no one to screen
<span class="smcap">Coles</span>, poor <span class="smcap">Coles&mdash;Coles</span> down again!&mdash;was shovelled
into a black hole, which was, <i>pro. tem.</i>, a <span class="smcap">Coles</span> cellar.
After sixteen months of Haytian bonds, and being kept
in durance by Haytian Black Guards, the energy of the
British F. O. obtained for the unfortunate prisoner a free
pardon! But no further redress, except the offer of £500,
which <span class="smcap">Coles</span> couldn't be &quot;cokes'd&quot; into accepting. Now
this matter of Hayti and <span class="smcap">Coles</span> is a very black affair.
What is going to be done? Do we leave <span class="smcap">Coles</span> and
scuttle? Surely so gross a wrong perpetrated in Hayti
ought to have been put right in Hayti-seven.</p>

<h2>&quot;THE BEARING OF IT LIES IN THE APPLICATION.&quot;</h2>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spare no efforts to maintain the magnificent inheritance which
has descended from your forefathers,&quot; said Mr. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>, when
bidding a temporary good-bye to Birmingham.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, it is a magnificent inheritance, and most certainly it is our
duty, as well as our interest, to maintain it. But how? Magnificent
as it is, it has certain incumbrances; memories of wrongs unredressed,
actualities of mismanagement unremoved. To maintain <i>these</i> is not
to improve the inheritance, and enable us to hand it down better
worth maintaining by those who will inherit it from us. As stewards
of the splendid patrimony of empire, we must not only keep it
together, but properly&mdash;that is, justly and sagaciously&mdash;administer it,
which, indeed, is the only sure and safe way of maintaining it. The
accumulated mortgage of our ancestors' errors and misdeeds is, unfortunately,
but inevitably, a part of our &quot;inheritance.&quot; To pay it
off may seem a burdensome duty, but a duty it is, in the resolute
doing, not the haughty ignoring or cowardly shirking, of which we
shall be at least as truly &quot;maintaining our inheritance,&quot; as by stroke
of sword, or statute of coercion. <i>Verb. sap</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Last week was remarkable for a number of <i>Matinées</i>. There were
two, each with a new Play, at the Vaudeville, in preparation
apparently for the disappearance of <i>Sophia</i>. The Author of one of the
pieces was, I fancy, Mr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>
(the name fixed itself on my
memory), but I am not quite
so sure about the others. I
rather think the first play
was written in collaboration
possibly by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>
and <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> to complete the
immortal <i>trio</i>. However, the
morning performance <i>par excellence</i>,
was the production
of a new and original poetical
drama in five Acts, called
<i>Nitrocris</i>, by <span class="smcap">Geo. Graves</span>, at
Drury Lane. This was really
a very interesting occasion,
as we were taken back to
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1420, and I must admit
that I too was rather taken
aback when I found the
Early Egyptians talking of
the &quot;Pharmacop&oelig;ia,&quot; and
many other matters of a
yet more recent date. I supposed
this was local colouring, and when I saw the &quot;Banquetting
Hall in the Palace,&quot; I felt sure that the Egyptian Court represented
belonged to the Nineteenth Century, and could be easily
discovered (either by season ticket or on payment of a shilling) in
Sydenham. The Author supplies a note in the official programme,
in which she informs the World that <span class="smcap">Amun-Mykera Nitocris</span> was
&quot;handsome among women, and brave among men, and governed for
her husband with great splendour and much justice, though she is
rebuked by several of the ancient historians for her cruelty and
sensuality,&quot; and no doubt these facts have suggested the five long
Acts of the more or less poetical play. What story there is shows how
the adopted son of and apprentice to an Embalmer, after being left
to die in the Palace of <i>Nitocris</i> for refusing to join in an unpatriotic
toast, escapes, and twelve weeks later is lured back once more to the
Royal realms to reject the suddenly-kindled love of the Egyptian
Queen in favour of the affection of a Grecian orphan called <i>Soris</i>,
who happens to be staying on a visit with her swarthy Majesty.
Then <i>Soris</i> gets half-poisoned and entirely stabbed, and <i>Nitocris</i> and
the Embalmer's Apprentice repair to a &quot;stretch of desert in the
neighbourhood of the Pyramids,&quot; to be drowned in an inundation
which is much talked about but never seen. As the Embalmer's
Apprentice, Mr. <span class="smcap">J. H. Barnes</span> fostered the impression that he was
either a very slow and dull pupil, or that the art of embalming had
taken him a middle-aged lifetime to thoroughly acquire. In the last
act he looked like a portly Friar of Orders Grey sadly in need of the
fast rising Nile. Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert Pateman</span> was good as a nigger
<i>Quasimodo</i>, who apparently had nothing in particular to do save to
murder Miss <span class="smcap">Alma Murray</span> when that popular young <i>tragédienne's</i>
sorrows became monotonous and required
curtailment in the interests of the audience.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fernandez</span> too was useful as Chief of
the Magi, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Bernard Gould's</span> performance
would have been more pleasing
had he really died at the end of the Second
Act, instead of living to see the final fall of
the curtain. But this last was rather the
Author's than the actor's fault. Personally
I should have been better satisfied had every
one died at the end of the First Act, but I
confess I am a little exacting. On Wednesday,
after the &quot;principals&quot; had been
called and received more or less applause, there was a cry for the
Authoress, when to my surprise a lady in a semi-masculine costume
and seemingly in her &quot;teens,&quot; made her way before the curtain.
This was young &quot;<span class="smcap">Clo</span>,&quot;&mdash;a most charming person to judge from her
personal appearance. There was a further &quot;call&quot; when a gentleman
of much maturer years was seen bowing. I do not know if he
was also a &quot;<span class="smcap">Clo</span>,&quot;&mdash;if so, he was unquestionably a much older
&quot;<span class="smcap">Clo</span>&quot;&mdash;in fact, quite an elderly &quot;<span class="smcap">Clo</span>.&quot; Ages ago a wonderful piece
called <i>Nitocris</i> was played at Drury Lane for a few nights with
moderate success. In it was represented an inundation, that, if it
did not precisely resemble the waters of the rising Nile, at any rate
was a capital realisation of green-coloured muslin sprinkled with
spangles. I am afraid that young &quot;<span class="smcap">Clo's</span>&quot; poetical play will not
keep the stage much longer than its predecessor.</p>

<p class="indent">It was my good fortune to be present at the opening of the
Manchester Exhibition (which <i>Mr. Punch</i> very appropriately
christened the &quot;Gem of the Jubilee,&quot;) and on Thursday last I again
paid it a visit with about sixty-five thousand other persons. In spite of
the hurricane of the preceding Monday, the building was in an
excellent condition, and the reproduction of the old part of the
ancient city had weathered the storm as if it had been intended to
remain for a thousand years instead of half-a-dozen months. I was
much struck with the extreme good-nature of a Lancashire crowd.
In the afternoon a severe shower of rain, which I fancy must have
come down from Town by the 10.10 Express from Euston (a train
which maintained the tradition of the L. &amp; N. W. R. by
arriving to the minute) drove all the pleasure-seekers from the
grounds into the building, and for a moment there was an &quot;ugly
block.&quot; Immediately the police and the other officials organised a
stream right and left, and when it was found that there were many
schools amongst the sight-seers, a cry of &quot;Make way for the
children!&quot; secured the safety of the little ones. The picture galleries
were as popular as ever, and I observed that the crowd generally
gathered in dense masses near the paintings with historical events as
their subjects. The arrival of the Princess of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> at Gravesend
was particularly favoured, and some regret was expressed that the
Benchers of the Middle Temple had required the return of the
portrait by <span class="smcap">Holl</span> of their Royal Treasurer. The splendid display
of the works of Mr. <span class="smcap">Watts</span> did not attract much attention, one lady
observing that it was &quot;a pity that they had not been finished,&quot; and
their opposite neighbours by Mr. <span class="smcap">Burne-Jones</span>, were also a
little above the heads (in more senses than one) of the average
shilling public. But <span class="smcap">Landseer</span>, <span class="smcap">Millais</span>, <span class="smcap">Poynter</span> and <span class="smcap">Holman
Hunt</span> had thousands of earnest admirers, and there were always
enthusiastic groups in front of &quot;<i>The Derby Day</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Ramsgate
Sands</i>.&quot; It was delightful to walk through the galleries
devoted to this unique, this magnificent collection of purely
native Art, only saddened by the reflection that such an opportunity
would never offer itself again. The machinery, from another
point of view, was nearly as interesting. I have been present at
many Exhibitions, but have never seen anything to equal the display
of &quot;works in operation.&quot; Both visitors and &quot;hands&quot; seemed to be
equally in earnest; the first to watch, and the second to work. Then
the music was excellent, as, indeed, it was obliged to be to satisfy
the requirements of Manchester connoisseurs, who are not to be put
off with second-rate bands. Lastly, the illuminated fountains were
absolutely fairy-like with their colours reflected from below the water-
line.
And this reminds me there was also something else fairy-like&mdash;the
<i>table d'hôte</i> dinner served in the Conservatory, which seemed
(with its many courses, of the daintiest proportions) to be exactly
suited to the wants of <i>Titania</i> and (if he took the hint printed on
the menu, and &quot;requiring extra quantities of any of the dishes,&quot;
asked for more) of the robuster <i>Oberon</i>. The captious might certainly
have objected that the dessert would have been more satisfactory
had nut-crackers been supplied with the walnuts. I asked for a
pair, but was told by my waiter that he could get me none. No
doubt this little defect will be remedied when the contractor fulfils
his intention of catering next year at the Brussels Exhibition. But
this is a detail. For the rest, the Manchester celebration of the
Fiftieth Year of Her Majesty's reign has been worthy of the occasion;
and my second visit has fully confirmed the opinion (that was
expressed in May last) that the leading town of Lancashire has
produced the Gem of the Jubilee.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="indent">There is no better form of book, providing always the print be
clear and distinct, than the volume which is adapted practically in
price and size to the pocket.
One man's pocket is more capacious
than another's, as one
man's purse is longer than
another's, and the latter can
purchase a volume more expensively
got up than the small,
useful, charming travelling
companions that <i>Mr. Punch</i>
has at this moment actually in
view while others are in his
mind's eye, Horatio. <i>The
Handy-Volume Shakspeare</i>
(<span class="smcap">Bradbury, Agnew, &amp; Co.</span>),
which in every way is the
model of a pocket-volume, the
model <i>par excellence</i>, is a
member of a family all in one
case, a perfect Christmas present.
But if one volume is
lost, the set is spoilt, and the
missing book cannot, in the
ordinary course of bookselling
nature, be replaced. Consequently only a very careful and methodical
person can venture upon travelling about with one of these
volumes as his pocket-companion. A little Shakespeare is a
dangerous thing. And this is why the small books belonging to
<i>Cassell's National Library,</i> price threepence apiece, ought to find
favour in the eyes of those who can read in a cab, in a coach, in a
train, or even walking. As to a man running and reading the
thing's almost impossible, and whoever saw a man on horseback
reading a book, except in an old print of <i>Doctor Syntax</i>? As the
snail carries his shell about with him, so every Englishman can
carry his own <i>Cassell</i>, and get rid of it too&mdash;which is more than the
snail can&mdash;and can lose it&mdash;and can replace it for the small sum of
threepence, or if secondhand (for being in limp covers they soon become
&quot;secondhand&quot; in appearance) for considerably less. With a volume
from this library carried always in the tail-pocket of his coat&mdash;the
very place to carry a short tale&mdash;no one need ever be idle, and every
spare moment, as long as he is wearing the coat, can be well occupied.
These bits of books are our modern <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
<a href="images/221a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/221a.png" alt="" /></a> <p>Handy Vols.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Nor must we forget the <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> series of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Routledge</span>, who
have just brought out a dainty little edition of the <i>Cricket on the
Hearth</i>. This is a lasting work got up in a lasting manner. And
so whether the tale be long, or short, pointed or not, every man for a
small sum, in some instances a very small sum, can be his own talebearer:
only the tale isn't his, it is somebody else's, but his by
purchase.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the handiest of handy books must be included the Pocket
Diaries for 1888, numbered, respectively, one, two, three,&mdash;of which
No. 3 is &quot;A1,&quot;&mdash;brought out by <span class="smcap">John Walker &amp; Co.</span> of Farringdon
House, and admirably adapted to all walkers, who can now bring
them out for themselves every day in the new year. One novelty
there is in <span class="smcap">Walker &amp; Co.'s</span> division of pages, and this is that two
are set apart for &quot;Addresses&quot;&mdash;not political ones, of course&mdash;and
two others for &quot;Visits&quot;&mdash;(such an idea could only have struck a
Walker who wanted an object for his walk)&mdash;these being subdivided
into columns headed &quot;<i>Name</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>Reception Day</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>Visit Received</i>,&quot;
&quot;<i>Visit Returned</i>,&quot; which in itself is quite a little manual, or
<i>Walker's Dictionary</i>, of politeness. To &quot;Cash&quot; is devoted a great
deal too much space; but, of course, if there is sufficient cash to fill
it, so much the better. If we might suggest a &quot;rider&quot; to <span class="smcap">Walker</span>,
it would be that, as many persons, who pay nothing else, are often
most assiduous in &quot;paying their addresses&quot; and in &quot;paying visits,&quot;
an equal space might be given to business as represented by &quot;Cash,&quot;
and to pleasure as represented by the two other items. The pencil
is a triumph of ingenuity, and the binding of No. 3 proves the truth
of the old adage, that there is nothing like leather, specially when
the leather is Russian.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Humility.</span>&mdash;The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, in its account of the consecration
of Truro Cathedral, stated how&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;The Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span> and the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Truro</span> received the
Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> at the Phillpotts porch, and conducted His Royal Highness
to a footstool placed for him in the choir. Every available inch of space was
crowded.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Poor Royal Highness! only a &quot;footstool&quot; to sit upon. He was
His Royal Lowness on this occasion. If, however, for &quot;footstool&quot;
we read &quot;faldstool,&quot; His Royal Highness's apparently uncomfortable
position becomes intelligible.</p>

<p class="indent">Will you not help us to make a stand even now against the
encroachments of realism in the pronunciation of Latin? My evening
paper has been full of it lately. Why,
Sir, it is well known that the Britons
understood the Romans, and the Romans
the Britons, and if the Romans had said
their repetition in the absurd foreign
fashion that a few modern-side pedants
advocate, is it likely that the Britons
would have understood them, much less
that they would have had so much respect
for them as to admit their garrisons,
and their Mayors, and their Corporations,
and what not for four or five
hundred years? And if our early ancestors had spoken Latin in this
eminently unmanly un-English fashion, why should we naturally
and instinctively pronounce it in our own way now, as if there were
no natural piety linking the chapters of our rough island story
together?</p>

<p class="indent">The Cambridge Augustan Johnnies (Dr. <span class="smcap">Sandys</span> at least, being a
Johnian, may excuse the term) set great store upon the fact that all
over the Continent the language is pronounced in the foreign manner.
Why, Sir, it is well known that the Norse tongue in Iceland, being
icerlated, has remained nearly unchanged since its introduction in
the ninth century. And England is an island; therefore the Latin
tongue, introduced by the Roman colonists, must have remained
unchanged also. For my own part, I own I have no patience with
this degradation of the hallowed traditions of our school-days to the
level of languages which can be got up in <i>Ollendorff</i> and fluently
pattered by couriers and waiters. &quot;Wenny, weedy, weaky.&quot; Good
gracious! Is that the language of a conquering, masterful race?
The matter does not admit of serious argument.</p>

<h2>&quot;CHARLES OUR FRIEND.&quot;</h2>

<p class="indent">Bravo, Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Warren</span>! The
roughs may consider you a Rabid Warren,
but what does that matter to you, or to us, or
to any lover of order, peace, and quietness in
this vast Metropolis? You're not a weasel to
be caught napping, and your recent Proclamation
is admirable, if its provisions be only
justly and exactly carried out. Your arrangements
too&mdash;talking of provisions&mdash;for housing
the houseless, seem to be remarkably judicious.
<i>Mr. Punch</i> trusts that the Processions which
you mention, and &quot;the wandering bands perambulating
the streets,&quot; which you are going
to consider as disorderly, will be taken to
include those disturbers of our Sunday Quiet,
calling themselves Members of the Salvation
Army, who, it is to be hoped, in every district
wherever their presence is not welcome to a
majority of the respectable residents, will be
summarily dispersed and their noise stopped.
On working days let perambulating bands
come out for air and exercise, only let them
take care that their &quot;air&quot; be always in tune.
That schools and clubs should have their
bands is an excellent thing. But there are
six days in the week for noise, and the Salvationists
can let us have our Sunday in
peace. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is all for freedom of
speech, and so he speaks out freely. He is
all for the liberty of the subject, but the
subject must remember that he is a subject,
and <i>Mr. Punch</i> takes the liberty to remind
him of it. At the meeting of real working
men of business to protest against these
meetings in Trafalgar Square, Mr. <span class="smcap">Frederick
Gordon</span> spoke up for his Metropole-itan interests
in Grand style. The <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span>,
it is to be hoped, carefully pondered the
speeches of these practical gentlemen. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Attenborough</span>, too,&mdash;&quot;O, my prophetic soul,
my uncle!&quot;&mdash;gave distinct evidence of the
injury done to trade in and about Trafalgar
Square. The Rev. Mr. <span class="smcap">Kitto</span> moved a
resolution, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Biddulph</span> seconded it,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Saying ditto</p>
<p class="i4">To Mr. <span class="smcap">Kitto</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">And <i>Mr. Punch</i> once more expresses his hope
that the first Act of next Session will be one
to regulate meetings and processions in and
about London, whereby orderly citizens may
enjoy their rights undisturbed. Trafalgar
Square and all our great thoroughfares should
be &quot;proclaimed districts,&quot; as regards the
loafers, roughs, and rowdies whose object is
plunder, and whose end is&mdash;or, at least, should
be&mdash;punishment.</p>

<h2>SCARLETINA AT TRURO.</h2>

<p class="indent">The æsthetic Archbishop <span class="smcap">Benson</span> has an eye for colour. At
Truro, the <i>Times</i> report says, &quot;he wore his scarlet robe and train,
which, as he moved from place to place in the Cathedral&quot;&mdash;very
restless of him, by the way&mdash;&quot;was upborne by two little acolytes
clad in scarlet cassocks and dainty surplices of lawn, and wearing
tiny scarlet caps upon their heads.&quot; The Archbishop is the big
scarlet, and the tiny acolytes might be called the scarletini. And to
think that years ago this sudden outbreak of archiepiscopal brilliancy
would have been inveighed against as trifling with the &quot;Scarlet
Lady.&quot; H.R.H. made an excellent speech on the occasion, and, with
the effect of colour still in his memory, he could not resist reminding
the æsthetic Dr. <span class="smcap">Benson</span> that &quot;seven years and a half ago&quot;&mdash;nothing
like being exact&mdash;&quot;he (H.R.H.) was enabled to lay the foundation
stone of this Cathedral with Masonic honours.&quot; &quot;Archbishop in
scarlet, forsooth! scarlet tiny acolytes!&quot; (such was evidently the
rebuke conveyed in H.R.H.'s speech)&mdash;&quot;you should just see Me as
Most Worshipful Grand Master, with my Wardens, Deacons,
Chaplains, and Tylers! Why, in comparison with that blaze of
splendour, you and your scarlet are nowhere. However, Ladies and
Gentlemen, I came here on this occasion, not 'to oblige <span class="smcap">Benson</span>,'
but to visit this ancient Duchy in my popular character of Duke of
<span class="smcap">Cornwall</span>. <i>Au revoir.</i>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Monsignor <span class="smcap">Persico</span>, <i>Truth</i> says, stayed with Archbishop <span class="smcap">Croke</span>,
and dined with the witty and popular Father <span class="smcap">James Healy</span>, P.P.
of Little Bray. Well, Monsignor <span class="smcap">Persico</span> must have heard a great
deal of croke-ing, but let us hope he has got some remedies for
healy-ing the wounds of the distressful country from <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
good friend, Father <span class="smcap">James</span>, of Little Bray, and precious little bray
about him.</p>

<h2>A MYSTERIOUS PAPER.</h2>

<p class="indent">The near approach of Christmas, with its fireside stories, has
suggested the following list of questions for examination that may
be put to himself by any intending <i>raconteur</i>. As he may be sure
that if he can tackle them satisfactorily he will be able effectually
to enchain any family circle he may come across during the coming
festive season, he may be safely recommended to go at them in all
confidence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">1. What is a &quot;spook&quot;? Have you ever met one in society?
Define &quot;telepathy.&quot; Can you send a &quot;telepathigram&quot;? If so, do
you think it would cost more than a halfpenny a word?</p>

<p class="indent">2. Write a short biographical notice of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Myers and
Gurney</span>. State which of the two you would rather be, and give, if
you can, your reasons for your answer.</p>

<p class="indent">3. Furnish a brief abstract, that must not exceed 300 pages, of
their joint work, <i>Phantasms of the Living</i>. What would be the
present price of the two volumes on <span class="smcap">Mudie's</span> Second-hand List?</p>

<p class="indent">4. A certain Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span> knew a Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, who knew a
Major <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, who one night sitting at Mess at a hill-station in
the Central Provinces of India, thought he saw a figure on the
verandah and felt a sudden dig in the side as if somebody had
pushed him with his elbow. He had been mixing his wines rather
freely, but turning to his neighbour, he said, &quot;I am almost sure
something has happened to my Uncle <span class="smcap">James</span>.&quot; He subsequently
wrote a dozen letters to England on the subject, but could never get
any answer; and to this day, though his Uncle <span class="smcap">James</span> is known to be
alive and quite well, the matter remains a mystery. To what class
of &quot;inconsequent warnings&quot; could you refer this experience?</p>

<p class="indent">5. At Bansbury House, Buckinghamshire, a phantom omnibus full
inside and out of headless passengers, drives three times round the
central grass-plot on the eve of the day on which the heir orders a
new dress-coat. Account for this, if you can, and compare it with
the reported apparition of the famous luminous elephant said to be
visible to the Lairds of Glenhuish whenever the amount of their
butcher's-book reaches the sum of £20.</p>

<p class="indent">6. Detail the circumstances that are said to explain the curious
conduct of the celebrated little old man in the bagwig and faded blue
velvet coat, that haunts the principal guest bedchamber at Tokenhouse
Manor. To what is he supposed to refer when after mournfully
shaking his head three times he says, &quot;It's the mustard that
did it!&quot; Examine this, and give some reasons to account for the fact
that he invariably disappears in the linen cupboard.</p>

<p class="indent">7. Give the various popular versions of the secret which imparted
at Rheums Castle to (1) the heir, on his attaining his majority, (2) the
family butler, and (3) a select circle of intimate friends who may have
chanced to attend on the occasion regarding the matter as an excellent
joke, instantly turns their hair white, causes them to look thirty
years older, and makes them talk in whispers, and wear an expression
of melancholy terror for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p class="indent">8. The hall of a well-known modern villa at Brixton is haunted
by the spectre of a coal-heaver, who carries his head under
his arm; and, whenever it is opened, he is visible on the mat, just
inside the front door. Tradesmen, therefore, calling with their
accounts, rush away, terror-stricken, without waiting for payment,
and visitors coming to five o'clock tea are carried off in violent
hysterics to the nearest chemist's. As the landlord cannot induce
any bailiffs to cross the threshold, the tenant who is, notwithstanding
their ghastly condition, quite cheerful on the premises, is several
quarters in arrear with his rent. State, under the circumstances,
what proceedings, if any, you would take to &quot;lay&quot; the ghost.</p>

<p class="indent">9. It is well known that the celebrated gallery at Bingham Place,
Somersetshire, is haunted, after midnight, by the apparition of a
knight in full armour, who heralds his approach by the clanking of
chains and cannon-balls, and who, after flinging about the boots and
hot-water cans standing at the doors of the various guest-chambers,
tumbles head-over-heels down-stairs, shrieking the refrain of a
thirteenth century hunting-chorus, and having thoroughly awakened
everybody sleeping on the premises, finally disappears with a loud
unearthly wail, in the butler's pantry. State what you think would
be the probable result of waiting for the appearance of this spectre,
and then suddenly hitting it hard over the knees with a cricket-bat.</p>

<p class="indent">10. Give the story of the well-known &quot;haunted house&quot; in Belgrave
Square. How would the unconscious tenant who had taken it
furnished be likely to account for the punctual appearance, at half-past
nine every evening, among his guests in the back drawing-room,
of the eyeless baronet, in a dressing-gown, dragging the two elderly
females by the hair of their heads about in a deadly struggle, and,
after continuing it for three-quarters of an hour, ultimately vanishing,
as if exhausted, apparently into the grand piano? Would you
advise him to take his guests into his confidence, and apologise for the
intrusion, or pretend to notice nothing unusual in the phenomenon,
and simply ignore it? Examine the situation, and conclude your
paper by dealing with it in the shape of a short essay on &quot;the
position of the Ghost considered in relation to Society.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Her Husband (mildly).</i> It certainly was <i>not</i>. Only, as the Show
can't possibly pass for two hours, at least&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>She.</i> <i>Two hours!</i> Am I to stand about in this crowd all <i>that</i> time?</p>

<span class="smcap">Duggie</span>, and we'll just stroll comfortably up and down till the very
last minute, and drop comfortably into front places, and there
we are!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Patriotic P.</i> What I like about occasions like this, is the spectacle

<p class="indent"><i>More Patriotic P. (thoughtfully).</i> No, that's perfectly true; and

<p class="indent"><i>A Socialist.</i> Ah, you're right. Did you year what one of the

Sir <span class="smcap">Charles</span> would 'ave to be as wide awake as what he was 'imself,

<h2>MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE CITY OF LONDON.</h2>

<p class="indent">The <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> was the first Privy Councillor created, and has
remained so ever since that auspicious event. On the death of the
Monarch, he presides at the meeting that is immediately summoned,
and appoints the new Cabinet, generally from the members of the
late Government,
but on one memorable
occasion he
appointed all the
members of the
Court of Aldermen
who had passed the
Chair, and although
they were
afterwards induced
to resign, it was
noticed that during
their short administration
matters
went on much as
usual. This was
called the Cabinet
of Absolute Wisdom,
after Alderman
<span class="smcap">Wood</span>, the
Prime Minister,
who was the First Lord of the Treasury who ever left more
in it than he found there. His beautiful daughter, <span class="smcap">Maria</span>, was
the reigning Toast of those hard-drinking days, and gave her
well-known name to the magnificent City Barge that periodically
conveys the City Fathers, together with the City Mothers, on their
several important inspections of the Silver Thames, in the neighbourhood
of Richmond and Twickenham. The matters they have to discuss
on these occasions are of so weighty a nature that they are compelled
to have five or six horses to draw them. On one occasion, and one
only, they managed to get as far as Oxford, an account of which
celebrated voyage was written by the Lord Mayor's Chaplain of the
time, under the title of &quot;Alderman <span class="smcap">Wenables</span>' Woyage to Hoxford,&quot;
a copy of which is still preserved in the Bodleian, among their most
cherished treasures, and can only be seen on special application, as
fabulous sums have been offered by the Court of Aldermen for its
destruction, it being the only copy that escaped when the whole
edition was ordered to be bought up and destroyed. This unique
volume is said to contain such astounding revelations as must be seen
to be believed, and would possibly not be believed even then.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the newly-elected Lord Mayor is sworn in, he has to produce
a Certificate from a Wine Merchant, &quot;residinge in ye Cittye,&quot;
and a Freeman of the Vintners' Company, that he has placed in the
capacious Cellar at the Mansion House, provided for that purpose,
ten Tuns, or one thousand dozen of good wine, for the year's consumption,
and whatever is left, <i>if any</i>, is distributed among the
Royal Hospitals, the quantity being carefully recorded by the learned
Recorder, which record is placed under the control of the equally
learned Comptroller, and remains for all time, as a witness to the
liberality or stinginess of the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of
that particular year.</p>

<p class="indent">The Sheriffs are the most ancient officers of the Corporation, having
been first elected in the reign of King <span class="smcap">Nebuchadnezzar</span>. A singular
custom still prevails, originating, it is said, in their association with
the grass-eating monarch. They are entitled, by virtue of their
office, to the first six bundles of sparrow-grass&mdash;as it was originally
spelt, and is still called by Members of the Corporation&mdash;that are
brought into Covent Garden Market: and his Grace the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Bedford</span> is always courteously invited to partake of it, at a sumptuous
banquet called &quot;the Grass Festival.&quot; (<i>Vide Stow</i>, cap. 23 of
<span class="smcap">Bell's</span> ed.)</p>

<p class="indent">The City Marshal was formerly a personage of great importance,
being in fact of the same rank as a Field Marshal, the only difference
being that one acted in the City and the other in the Field, whence
their names. The City Marshal was the City Champion, and always
rode into Guildhall, fully armed, on Lord Mayor's Day, at the commencement
of the Banquet, and, throwing down a glove, dared anyone
to mortal combat who disputed the rights of the Lord Mayor.
If no one accepted his challenge, he quaffed a flagon of sack to his
Lordship's health, and then cleverly and gracefully backed out of
the Hall. It is recorded that on one occasion his challenge was
accepted by a gallant Common Councilman who had been fulfilling
the important duties of Wine-taster, and who, when called upon to
name time and place for the deadly encounter, said, in the memorable
words of the great <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, &quot;Here and now!&quot; which so
astonished the Champion that he pleaded sudden indisposition, and
withdrew. The custom has since been discontinued. The gallant
Common Councilman was made Deputy of the Ward of Port-soaken.</p>

<p class="indent">In ancient times the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>, as every one knows, had a Fool
all to himself, and he was the only Fool permitted in the City. The
appointment was open to all by competitive examination. On the
occasion of a <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> making a Fool of himself the office was
abolished by the Common Council from motives of economy. In
memory of this ancient privilege the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> once in the season
has a fool&mdash;a gooseberry fool&mdash;all to himself.</p>

<h2>A NAPPY HOLIDAY.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;">
<a href="images/228b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/228b.png" alt="" /></a> <p>Going Nap.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Any Time in August.</i>&mdash;Just been reading capital article in <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>, by Dr. <span class="smcap">James Muir Howie</span>, on the &quot;Nerve Rest-Cure,&quot;
which says&mdash;&quot;For those who cannot get a sufficient holiday,
the best substitute is an occasional day in
bed.&quot; Why not several days in bed? In
fact one's whole summer holiday? &quot;Better
than climbing toilsome mountains,&quot; he remarks.
Quite so&mdash;and much better than
toilsome trip to Ramsgate with one's whole
family in tow. (Think of the Old Woman
who lived in a Shoe. <i>She</i> had all her
family in <i>toe</i>. Laugh feebly at my own
joke. Really my nerves must be <i>very</i> bad.)
Best feature of new holiday plan, however,
is its <i>cheapness</i>. Was quite at a loss how
to afford our annual trip till <span class="smcap">Howie</span> came
to rescue with his &quot;(y)early to bed&quot; cure. Announce to family
that I intend following Dr. <span class="smcap">Howie's</span> advice. Family seems too
stupefied to say anything.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;Family has found its voice. Protests unanimously and
quite fiercely against new holiday plan. Wife &quot;sure I can afford
trip to sea-side.&quot; If not, <i>where</i> does my money go to? Argument
forcible, but unpleasant.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>First Day.</i>&mdash;Holiday begins. Sleep till 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Scrumpshous!
Should have slept longer, but two hurdy-gurdies stop outside, playing
different airs. Not only murder the tunes, but &quot;murder sleep&quot;
as well. Listen for ten minutes&mdash;nerves terribly shaky. Oughtn't
to get out of bed, <span class="smcap">Howie</span> says, but must. See my eldest boy, <span class="smcap">Henry</span>,
giving Italian fiends money! What does this unwonted generosity
mean?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Afternoon.</i>&mdash;Dinner in bed not a success. Everything underdone.
Tell wife. She says, &quot;Cook and servants in bad tempers; thought
we were all going to Ramsgate, and they would have rest.&quot; Rest
means clandestine kitchen parties. Feel angry&mdash;bad for nerves, but
can't help it. Sleep impossible, as bed full of crumbs. Wonder
<span class="smcap">Howie</span> didn't think of this. Send <span class="smcap">Henry</span> for evening paper&mdash;perhaps
it will soothe me.</p>

<p class="indent">It doesn't. He brings back one three days old. Says shopman
gave it him! Send him again, and shop closed for night. Nerves
actually <i>worse than ever</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Second Day.</i>&mdash;Had disturbed night, owing to lack of my usual
exercise yesterday. Still must stick to <span class="smcap">Howie's</span> prescription. Terrific
row in house. Wife comes up after breakfast (in tears) to say
children, deprived of sea-side trip, are ungovernable; pretend to be
buffaloes and Cowboys <i>in drawing-room</i>! Already two valuable
vases wrecked. Hang the children! Hang Colonel CODY too! Still
even paying for new vases cheaper than Ramsgate lodgings. Read
morning paper. Just dropping off to sleep over somebody's important
speech on Ireland, when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Three</i> hurdy-gurdies outside! Rush to window, open it, and bid
men avaunt. They won't avaunt. Say &quot;they've been ordered to
come every morning for a month by the young gent.&quot; This must be
<span class="smcap">Henry's</span> &quot;Plan of Campaign.&quot; Send for him, and find he has
prudently gone out. Nothing for it but to stuff cotton-wool into
ears till men go. Cotton-wool in ears for a whole hour <i>shatters</i> nerves.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Third Day.</i>&mdash;Much worse. Though I've given strict orders that
no letters or bills are to be sent up to my bed-room, find Tax-Collector's
little &quot;Demand-Note&quot; wrapped in fold of morning
paper! Annoyed. Perhaps, after all, <span class="smcap">Howie</span> wrong. Hullo!
what's that? Somebody on my window-sill! Burglars? No,
can't be. How bad all this is for my nerves. Spring up in time to
see <span class="smcap">Henry</span> disappearing down rope-ladder, which he and his brothers
have let down from roof. How horribly dangerous! Ring violently.
Hear heavy thud in garden. Talk of &quot;Nerve Rest-Cure&quot;&mdash;rest of
my nerves gone long ago, none left to be cured.</p>

<p class="indent">Wife (in tears again&mdash;awfully bad for nerves this) says the thud
was not <span class="smcap">Henry</span> falling; boys have pulled down part of chimney,
which has smashed the front steps&mdash;that's all. She suggests that
perhaps, after all, this holiday plan in bed is not so good as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Five hurdy-gurdies</i> to-day! Maddening! Hired by <span class="smcap">Henry</span>,
wife says. Send <i>him</i> to bed for whole day; we'll see how he likes
&quot;Rest-Cure&quot; for <i>his</i> nerves. Get up gloomily, dress, and go downstairs.
Pitch <i>Nineteenth Century</i> into waste-paper basket. Feel
nerves better after it. Decide on Ramsgate, as usual, and so ends
my holiday in bed&mdash;my &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; day!</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
